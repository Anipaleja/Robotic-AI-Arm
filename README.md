# Robotic-AI-Arm

This AI Robotic Arm is a robotic arm powered by electromyography (EMG) sensors and artificial intelligence, as well uses OpenCV to detect input hand gestures and mimic those to the arm. Designed to respond to muscle signals and intelligently adapt to its environment, this arm brings advanced assistive technology and human-robot interaction into one cohesive system.

# Features (Planned & In Progress)

**EMG-Based Control:** Responds to actual muscle signals using MyoWare sensors.

**Servo Motor Articulation:** Controls multiple degrees of freedom for realistic arm movement.

**User Recognition:** Detects and identifies users to trigger personalized gestures.

**AI Integration:** Performs intelligent decision-making based on environmental inputs and identity recognition.

**Multi-Sensor Input:** Button control, potentiometer movement, and LED indicators already integrated.

**Modular Expansion:** Designed for future upgrades with cameras, haptic feedback, and more.
